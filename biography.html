        <p>Hello everybody! My name is Claire Donnan. I am a 19 year old, second-year Digital Journalism major at the<a href="https://www2.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank">University of Ottawa.</a> from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, this is my second year living in Ontario.</p>
        <p>I've been a lover of performance of all kinds since I was very young. I was born into it, my aunt is a music and theatre teacher, my grandfather is a former actor and classical singer, and my dad has also been singing and acting for much of his life. I started dancing at three, singing and acting at seven, and carried these pastimes through my childhood and even in early adulthood, as I still try to take jobs and roles in the performance sector whenever I can.</p>

        <p>When I reached high school and stopped having the time to perform in theatre (though I still trained), I turned my eyes to other creative avenues that would allow me to combine my love of writing and reading with my love of performance. I joined Model UN and the debate team, and discovered a love of writing, arguing and communication. Finally, in grade 12 I restarted my school's newspaper, fell in love with the writing, and the rest was history!</p>
        <p>In my day-to-day life as a young adult in Ottawa I've been trying to get back to some of the things I loved when I was younger. I've been looking for <a href="https://www.perchancetheatre.com"> theatre and singing projects </a> to take part in, and am getting back into martial arts. Every day is full of new experiences and adventures, and I am so thankful for the life I get to live. Lots of love! -Claire </p>
